• Overview of what you did (i.e. what are the controls? Why this design?)

I created a little game where you can spawn balls, pick them up and throw them at targets!!! For each one you hit you will get a point and if 
you get 3 points you win the game and the targets will disappear. 

Controls for the PC are: 
wasd to move, left click to pick up and space to throw 

For phone or Tablet: 
Touch button to spawn/ pick up. and use camera to control the direction of the ball and press on the targets to shoot! 


• What was challenging.

Everything was challenging especially using physics to throw the ball. I used many references online. Here are the main references that helped me the most

• What went well (i.e. how did you solve the above challenges?).

Spending a lot of time working and using google to find help. Also going to class and working there and asking many questions :) (Sorry I ask too many)
